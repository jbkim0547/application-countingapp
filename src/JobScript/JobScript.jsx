        Hello Kelly, hope I can connect you and join your successful career
        path! <br /> <br />
        It's nice to connect Trvor. I was wondering if you can give me a HUGE
        favor and give me an advice or help for the position that I applied for
        OpenDoor. <br /> <br />
        I recently applied for Aruba as a software engineer position, and I
        thought it would be a great idea to talk to someone who is actually
        working there to get ANY advices regarding interview and further
        process. ANY advice or support would be appreciated!
        <br /> <br />
        Also, I am not sure if it is appropriate to ask since we just connected
        in the Linkedin today but do you think you could refer me or pass my
        info to the hiring manager for the position that I applied? That would
        mean a lot to me as well! <br /> <br />
        I’d like to share that I’m someone who truly enjoys building solutions
        that make an impact. Whether it’s improving internal efficiency or
        creating user-friendly experiences, I take pride in writing clean,
        maintainable code and continuously learning new technologies. Beyond my
        technical background, I bring strong collaboration skills and a
        proactive mindset. I’ve worked cross-functionally with product owners,
        QA teams, and designers, and I believe that great software comes from
        great teamwork. <br /> <br />
