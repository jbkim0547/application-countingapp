Hello Kelly, hope I can connect you and join your successful career path!

It's nice to connect Trvor. I was wondering if you can give me a HUGE favor and give me an advice or help for the position that I applied for OpenDoor.

I recently applied for Aruba as a software engineer position, and I thought it would be a great idea to talk to someone who is actually working there to get ANY advices regarding interview and further process. ANY advice or support would be appreciated!

Also, I am not sure if it is appropriate to ask since we just connected in the Linkedin today but do you think you could refer me or pass my info to the hiring manager for the position that I applied? That would mean a lot to me as well!

Below is the position that I applied just in case you want to take a look.


I am looking for new opportunities that have right people to work with and contribute my skillset and grow along with the team and company.

As a passionate and talented employee, I would like to contribute my skillset to the team and company so I can grow along with the Team!
